GENERAL PROBLEM
***************
- The general problem I am trying to solve is to find a way for a user
to add either a Book or a Journal to an ArrayList (Library)
- When entering books or journals (objects) to the Library they are
required to fullfill the fields of data to create an object.
- The user is also given the option to search for a book or journal
by entering keywords

ASSUMPTION AN LIMITATIONS
*************************
- The program I have made will correctly ask the user for Strings
of data the make a book or journal object
- Objects created are correctly added to ArrayLists
- User can search for Books or Journals and results from each ArrayList
will be displayed to the user

Limitations
- Will accept blank space as input (Expects user to enter data for each String in object)
- Accepts the years as a String
- Will display duplicate search results

HOW TO BUILD AND TEST
*********************
- Place the .java files into a 'src' folder and import the library
into NetBeans
- Netbeans will compile the program and run it

POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS
*********************
- I would definitly improve my error checking (My some object fields
be mandatory to enter)
- Not print duplicate results when looking through ArrayLists
- Improve search results for entering the year range
