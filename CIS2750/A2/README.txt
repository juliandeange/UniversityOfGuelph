Type make
Run the python script in 1 terminal with: python3 manip.py

- Will read filename, process it, pass it to python for further manipulation
  and pass it back to C program will it will be printed to stdout and written
  to a FILENAME.html file
- If FILENAME.html exists in directory it will be printed to stdout
- Should be no memory leak errors when ran with valgrind
