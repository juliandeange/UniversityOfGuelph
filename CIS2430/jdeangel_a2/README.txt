CIS2430 - Assignment 3 - README - Julian De Angelis

 |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | This program was built from the Assignment 1 Soultions that the Professor Provided|
 |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
             ********** My Program was built of of his code **********


General Problem
***************
- This program allows the user to add a book or journal (of type <Reference>) object
to an arrayList
- The title keyword are split and added to a hasmap in addtion
- The hashmap allows the program to more efficiently search for refernces that exist
- The porgram will read and write added references to and from a text file


Features
********
- Takes in user input (not case sensitive -- User friendly / defensive)
- Asks user if they want to add a book or journal and asks for required fields
- Creates and object from the data and adds to an arrayList
- Title keywords are tokenized and added to the hashmap to improve search speed
- When adding a reference, the fields entered from the user are written to a text file in the root directory


Limitations
*********************
- Program will only write to the text file specified in the code
- Will not read from the text file


Possible Improvements
*********************
- Allow existing refernces to be put in a text file, imported, and added to the arrayList and hashmap
