Binary Heap
***********
- Reads in file
- Insert function works but indexing may be off
- When printing heap, only prints the last student to be added
- All functions in HeapImplementation.c are written

Binary Search Tree
******************
- Insert() in myProgram.c is commented out because of error inside of copyValue() causes program to see fault
- Insert function should be working correctly if it werenâ€™t for the error inside in CopyValue()
- Shows almost expected output except for if balanced and height

AVLTree
*******
- Does not properly balance the tree
